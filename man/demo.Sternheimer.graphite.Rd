\title{demo.Sternheimer.graphite
Computation of electronic stopping power and density effect for graphite
using Sternheimer model as described in ICRU-90.

How to compute the density-correction for a conductor
like graphite? Move one or more electrons to nc (i.e.
binding energy zero).
Compounds should be treated as an insulator.
In this example, we use the recommended values of I = 81 eV for graphite
and we also set the density to the gRAIN DENSITY (2.265 g/cm3) which has some implications
for the density-effect correction.}
